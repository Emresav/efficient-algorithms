This repository includes some challenging algorithms that I developed as a part of Algorithmic Toolbox module on Coursera. 

Problem description:

1) largest_numberCW.cpp
    task: Compose the largest number out of a set of integers.
    input: The first line of the input contains an integer n. The second line contains a set of integers
    out: Output the largest number that can be composed out of these integers
    challenge: the task is easy whem the integers are only single digits. this algorithm can handle multi-digit integers too.
  
2) different_summandsCW.cpp: 
    task: represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as
a1 + a2 + ··· + ak where a1 ,..., ak are positive integers and a i ̸= a j for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k.
    input: integer n
    out: In the first line, output the maximum number k such that n can be represented as a sum of k pairwise distinct positive integers. In the second line, output k pairwise distinct positive integers
that sum up to n (if there are many such representations, output any of them).
